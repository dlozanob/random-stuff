1. On-Demand Instances
   - Description: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitment. Mostly by second.
   - Use Case: Ideal for applications with unpredictable workloads or short-term projects. Short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted

2. Reserved Instances
    - Description: Provide a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for a one- or three-year commitment.
    - Use Case: Best for applications with steady-state or predictable usage.

3. Spot Instances
    - Description: Allow you to bid on spare Amazon EC2 capacity at a lower price than On-Demand instances.
    - Use Case: Suitable for flexible workloads, batch jobs, and applications that are fault-tolerant.

4. Savings Plans
    - Description: Flexible pricing model offering lower prices compared to On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one- or three-year term.
    - Use Case: Ideal for users who want to reduce costs with a flexible commitment.

5. Dedicated Hosts
    - Description: Physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
    - Use Case: Useful for meeting compliance requirements and reducing costs by using existing server-bound software licenses.

*Standard Reserved Instances*
- Discount: Typically offer the highest discount compared to On-Demand pricing.
- Flexibility: Limited to modifications within the same instance family, such as changing the Availability Zone, scope, networking type, and instance size.
- Marketplace: Can be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

*Convertible Reserved Instances*
- Discount: Offer a smaller discount than Standard Reserved Instances.
- Flexibility: Can be exchanged for another Convertible Reserved Instance with different attributes, including instance family, operating system, and tenancy. There are no limits to how many times you can perform an exchange, as long as the target Convertible Reserved Instance is of equal or higher value.
- Marketplace: Cannot be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

Convertible Reserved Instances are useful if you anticipate changes in your workload or need more flexibility in your instance configurations. Standard Reserved Instances are ideal if you want the highest discount and have a stable, predictable workload.

_AWS Organizations_ provides you with the capability to centrally manage and govern your cloud environment.
You can manage and organize your accounts under a single bill, set central policies and configuration
requirements for your entire organization, create custom permissions or capabilities within the organization,
and delegate responsibilities to other accounts so they can manage on behalf of the organization.
In addition, _AWS Organizations_ is integrated with other AWS services so you can define central configurations,
security mechanisms, audit requirements, and resource sharing across accounts in your organization.

>[!Note]
> You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed
> level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource
> costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs.
